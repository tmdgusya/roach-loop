# Spec Planning Mode

I'll help you create a focused specification document through interactive questioning.

**Quick Commands:**
- Type "skip" to skip optional questions
- Type "draft" to see current spec draft
- Type "save" to finalize and save the spec

Let me spawn the spec-planner agent to guide you through this process.
